# Josh's Neovim Config
Friendship ended with Emacs; now Neovim is my best friend.

## Features
- Configuration is mindful of [VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=asvetliakov.vscode-neovim)
- Included config for [Neovide](https://neovide.dev/)
- Package management with Packer and Mason
- LSP and completion configuration
- Snippets with [LuaSnip](https://github.com/L3MON4D3/LuaSnip)
- More!

## Windows
Supported on Windows as much as possible.
Please enable developer mode as Packer requires it for symlinks.

### Known Windows Issues
- Neogit does not create commits. Use fugitive for commits.
See [Neogit issue](https://github.com/TimUntersberger/neogit/issues/424)
